Description: This package lets you implement fuzzy merging so you can merge datasets
    when the values to be matched aren't exactly the same. It also includes a clean
    function to remove prefixes, sufixes, and other sequences of characters which
    the user wants to remove. It also includes a function, scramble(), which will change
    some of the characters of the selected column to allow for testing of the package.
